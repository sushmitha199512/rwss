                            <br>
                            In exercise of powers conferred by article 309 of the Constitution of India, Government further decided to bifurcate PR &amp; RD Department into Panchayati Raj and Rural Water Supply Departments. Accordingly Panchayat Raj Rural development Engineering service gets bifurcated into Panchayat Raj Engineering service and Rural water Supply Engineering Service during the Year 2007 and deemed to have been created with effect from <strong>1.4.2008 </strong>.                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It functions directly under the Ministry of Rural water Supply with Principal Secretary to Government (RWS) as its administrative head and Engineer-in-Chief as its technical head.&nbsp;                            <br>

                            The Drinking Water Supply is a very important issue as over 80% of health problems are due to consumption of unsafe water and increasing health awareness among the rural public, underlines the additional attention to be paid to the subject. Hence, one of the most important programs of the Government is the provision of safe drinking water to the rural population. </td>
